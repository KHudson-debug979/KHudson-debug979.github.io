	<p class="textSizeOne">I live in the Seaforth area with my partner and two daughters. My daughters are<br> 3 and 15. Some of my hobbies include fishing, gaming and playing electric guitar.<br>I have 4 fish in 2 tanks, but they're fish, so I never have to worry about them <br>making much mess. I'm a pretty laid back guy overall, and I consider myself <br>approachable and friendly. My favourite sport is NFL. Go Patriots.</p>

	<p class="textSizeOne">My first interest in IT was a young kid playing Doom and Quake. I wondered what made this wonderful machine work the way it did. I'm very interested in networking and hardware; building custom computers is something I enjoy. I;d love to build my own server, but currently lack the funds. I eventually got my own second hand computer and wrecked it within a week. Being a very experimental child, I deleted System32; after all, it was taking up so much space. When I was young, I ended up in foster care several times and one of the best places I ever stayed with was with my primary school IT teacher and his family. The efforts that family went to still blow my mind. I became who I am because of them. My teacher/foster father instilled a love of computers and IT that has lasted my entire life. I don't have much IT experience beyond clearing viruses from friends laptops and building my own PC. I tried to learn programming myself a few years ago, but I struggled with C++ and gave up after a couple months. I chose RMIT because it is well known for being great for IT. I figured I would pick the school with the best reputation for IT that I knew of. To be fair, I never gave it much thought. Somebody on Reddit messaged me when I was struggling and gave me the encouragement to enrol and get started, so I jumped in feet first and now, here we are. I'm hoping to become a competent programmer and learn more about networking, though I expect the total sum of knowledge I acquire to be much greater by the end of my studies. I don't really know exactly what my dream job would be, but I've been leaning more towards becoming a network engineer more than anything else.

	<h3>Project Idea</h3>

	<p class="textSizeOne">For my project, I'd like to create an app that allows disbaled children, like my 3 year old daughter, able to communicate more efectively. I know apps like this already exist, but they can be quite expensive. I'd like to create and release a free app that could potentially help hundreds of kids, not just my daughter. To do this, I'll need a lot more programming knowledge than I currently possess. The app would feature coloured shapes to touch that give a response, like a short 10 second piece of music. Other parts to add in would be even more important, like learning words, and being able to touch a pictue of something and have the device say what my child wants ie. "I want lunch" or "I need a nappy change". Many nonverbal children really struggle with communication for obvious reasons, but the app I'd like to develop would make that communication so much easier and less frustrating for kids.</p>
